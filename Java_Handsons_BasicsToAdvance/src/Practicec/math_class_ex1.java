/*
 * Please note that whenever a method is called, a particular nomenclature is
 * used where we first specify the class that the particular method belongs to,
 * e.g. Math.round( ); where Math is the class name and round is the method
 * name. If a particular method accepts parameters, these are placed in
 * brackets, e.g. Math.max(2.8, 12.9) â€“ in this case it would return 12.9 as
 * being the larger number. A useful method is the Math.random( ) which would
 * return a random number ranging between 0.0 and 1.0.
